## Graph Algorithms course from AGH University of Science and Technology (Computer Science).

All code was written during the course time (10.2021-02.2022).

### Timetable
* **Lab 1** - Warm-up. Find path from s to t with minimal cost.
* **Lab 2** - Max-flow problem implementations using DFS and BFS.
* **Lab 3 and 4** - Minimum cut problem. Stoer-Wagner algorithm implementation.
* **Lab 5 and 6** - Chordal graphs, LexBFS, finding PEO, vertex cover.
* **Lab 7** - Working with NertworkX library, graph planarity, SAT-2CNF.

Scripts that explain each of those subjects and describe given tasks (in Polish) are attached in specific folders.

### Projects
During the course we had to solve two tasks related to subjects we discussed and learned during the laboratories. 

#### * Project #1 - Minimum cost flow problem using cycle-cancelling algorithm. :white_check_mark:
#### * Project #2 - Disjoint 3-cycle cover. :soon:
